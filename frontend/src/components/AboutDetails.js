         The website was created by two students Dan and Hong as part of our 3rd-year final project.
         It was designed to showcase the skills and knowledge we gained during our studies, 
         and we put a lot of effort into creating it, conducting research and testing its functionality.
          The website reflects their creativity and innovation in web development, and we had to come up with a unique concept for it, 
          implementing it using various tools and technologies. Throughout the project, we received guidance and support from our project supervisor, 
          helping us to overcome challenges and achieve our goals. 
          The project has given us valuable experience and skills that will benefit us in our future careers.
